/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use the DFRobot HuskyLens.
 *
 * The HuskyLens is a Vision Sensor with a built-in object detection model.  It can
 * detect a number of predefined objects and AprilTags in the 36h11 family, can
 * recognize colors, and can be trained to detect custom objects. See this website for
 * documentation: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/HUSKYLENS_V1.0_SKU_SEN0305_SEN0336
 *
 * For detailed instructions on how a HuskyLens is used in FTC, please see this tutorial:
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/devices/huskylens/huskylens.html
 * 
 * This sample illustrates how to detect AprilTags, but can be used to detect other types
 * of objects by changing the algorithm. It assumes that the HuskyLens is configured with
 * a name of "huskylens".
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
